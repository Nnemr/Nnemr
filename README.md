### Hi! I'm Youssef Alnemr ðŸ‘‹

I am a Software Engineer, with a total of 4 years of experience in the industry. I first started my career as a Developer Evangelist at IBM, where I spent 2 years there. After realizing my career goals align more with building and shipping software, I decided to convert to Software Engineering, building and designing highly-performant software, with quality in consideration. I have experience working with Java, Spring Boot, JUnit, Gradle, MySQL, and Swagger. I have a dual BSc Computer science degrees from the British University in Egypt and London South Bank University.
